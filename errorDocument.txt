Errors:

Circle.java :
On line 34 (in scale) the factor by which the circle was being scaled was only
being added to the radius of the circle. This was not changing the size of the
circle by the factor. This was discovered on the doubleSize test which found that
inputting a factor of 2 was not doubling the radius of the circle.

On line 48 (in moveBy) the center.y was being changed to itself plus the xOffset
rather than the yOffset. This was discovered by the simplePositiveMoveXOnly test. 
This test was supposed to only change the x coordinate but was changing both.

Circle1.java :
On line 13 (in intersects) I added a new condition to handle cases when a circle is inside
another circle but not touching edges. This was discovered by the containedAwaytest which
had a circe within the first that did not touch edges anywhere but the intersects method 
was returning true.

On line 17 (in intersects) the if condition for the intersect to be true was
simply checking if the x distance between centers was less than the radius of
the first circle and the y distance between centers was less than the radius.
This didn't check if the circles intersected and was discovered by overlapIntersect test.



Circle2.java :
On line 19 (in intersects) I added a new condition to handle cases when a circle is inside
another circle but not touching edges. This was discovered by the containedAwaytest which
had a circe within the first that did not touch edges anywhere but the intersects method 
was returning true.

On line 9 the super call to constructor(in constructor) interchanged the x and y coordinates.
This was discovered by the simpleMove test. Since the x and y coordinates were
expected to both change to certain values this showed that the x and y coordinates
were not being set properly

On line 22 the if condition for the intersect to be true(in intersects) check for if d (distance
between centers) was less than radius of the first circle. This did not find
that the overlapping circles were intersecting and was found by overlapIntersect
test.
